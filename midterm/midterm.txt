You will place all the answers for your exam in this file.
Please do not place your name anywhere in this file.

Problem 1
---------
A.False, it does not matter if I have 1 ints and 2 chars. It is going to take 8Bytes.Memory consumption is the same.
struct testing1
{
	// int a;
	char b;
	char c;
	int a;
};

B.False, char has alignment 1B, int has alignement 4B. It does not matter and the size was the same.
struct testing2
{
	char x;
	int y;
	char z;
};

C.False, alignment is the same not matter the order.

D.Padding to respect the alignment. (2/n)*7

E.zero because if you have 3 integers nothing is lost.

Problem 2
---------
A. The compiler will not complain (reject) except for #5 (struct {int m;} a)
For all numbers 1-4, the compiler assumes that it is true. For number 5 it will be false because the compiler cannot sum a struct with an integer.
B.
C.int isnegative = (x & (1UL << (sizeof(x) * CHAR_BIT - 1))) != 0;

Problem 3
---------
A.Errors avoided would be: double-free + unaligned access + Unsigned integer overflow depends of the type of system
B. int main(){int *i = malloc(sizeof(4));}
C.(2) Writing the pointe to a disk file and reading it back later ; (3) Using the least-significant bit of the pointer to store a flag ; (5) Splitting the pointer into two parts and storing the parts in an array.

Problem 11
----------
A.The videos are excellent. Whatever is taught there I understand it. The teacher is excellent helping me visualize the abstract concepts.
B.Piazza is not helpful at all. It spams my inbox. It is almost like noise to me. 
Franco is available and helpful. That is a relief. 
Psets are challenging and fun. However, I enjoyed the most the sample midterm because I had to picture (in my head) and understand every single concept asked. It was the excellent format for me to challenge the knowledge I have acquired.
